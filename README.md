# AR web examples for my defense

A few examples to illustrate the slowness and ray surfaces of the quasi-shear waves in anisotropic media:

- **Test** : Open to test if it works on your device. [Test](https://yuriyi.github.io/Defense-AR/apps/test.html)

- **Phase domain**: Slowness surfaces of the quasi shear wave in an orthorhombic model. [Phase surfaces](https://yuriyi.github.io/Defense-AR/apps/phase.html)

- **Group domain**: Group velocity surfaces of the quasi shear wave in an orthorhombic model. [Wave surfaces](https://yuriyi.github.io/Defense-AR/apps/group.html)
