# AR web examples for my defense

A few examples to illustrate the complexity of slowness and ray surfaces of quasi-shear waves in anisotropic media:

Here is a difference between phase and group directions in anisotropic world:

## Test model

- **Test** : Open to test if it works on your device. [Test](https://yuriyi.github.io/Defense-AR/apps/test.html)

## Relatively simple model

- **Phase domain**: Slowness surfaces of the quasi shear waves in an orthorhombic model. [Phase surfaces](https://yuriyi.github.io/Defense-AR/apps/phase.html)

- **Group domain**: Group velocity surfaces of the quasi shear waves in an orthorhombic model. [Wave surfaces](https://yuriyi.github.io/Defense-AR/apps/group.html)

## Mindnumbingly complicated stuff

- **Phase domain**: Slowness surfaces of the quasi shear waves in an orthorhombic model with 16(!) singularity directions. [Phase surfaces](https://yuriyi.github.io/Defense-AR/apps/phase_singularities.html)

- **Group domain**: Group velocity surfaces of the quasi shear waves in an orthorhombic model with 16(!) singularity directions. [Wave surfaces](https://yuriyi.github.io/Defense-AR/apps/group_singularities.html)
